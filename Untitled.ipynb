    "The main goal of data scientist is to extract knowledge from data. In order to extract knowledge from data and implement machine learning algorithms it is necessary to get to know the data to understand the problem. Getting to know the data is termed Exploratpry Data Analysis (EDA). EDA allows data scientist to fix errors within the dataset and at the same time understand the relation and importance of every attribute within the dataset. The road map to a machine learning algorithm is summarized as:\n",
